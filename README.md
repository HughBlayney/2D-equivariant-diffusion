# 2D-equivariant-diffusion
Generating 2D structues using a generative diffusion model, composed of rotationally equivariant GNN layers.

This code is based off the paper [Equivariant Diffusion for Molecule Generation in 3D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17003), and some parts of the code were written with their (amazing!) [implementation](https://github.com/ehoogeboom/e3_diffusion_for_molecules) as reference.
